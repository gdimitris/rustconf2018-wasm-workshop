# .slide-header[Part I]

## LET'S GET HYPE

---
class: left, top

# .slide-header[What is "the web platform"?]

## It should be "the web *application* platform."

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About platforms]

# Platforms consist of:

1. An ISA (instruction set architecture)
2. A runtime environment and its API
3. Tooling to help you build stuff

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About platforms]

# Case study: UNIX on x86

1. ISA: x86
2. Runtime: UNIX (wait what?)
3. Tooling: shell, C, gcc

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About platforms]

# Case study: Java

1. ISA: Java Bytecode
2. Runtime: JVM
3. Tooling: javac

---
class: center, middle
# .slide-header[About platforms]

## The web platform is unusual in that it was developed out of order and it historically has had missing pieces

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About platforms]

## Other platforms were local, then networked.

## The web platform is networked, and only now becoming local.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About platforms]

# The browser was a *viewport* into an *application on the server*.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About platforms]

# This limits the kind of applications that we can build on the web platform.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Next steps for the web platform]

# Where are we going?

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Next steps for the web platform]

## Further developing the web platform's capabilities requires filling in the missing pieces.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Next steps for the web platform]

# Case study: Web Platform

### 1. ISA: ???
### 2. Runtime: JavaScript + Platform APIs
### 3. Tooling: So so so so so many

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Next steps for the web platform]

# JavaScript as ISA?

## Sort of, but not *really*.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Next steps for the web platform]

# JavaScript was not designed for this task.

## "Compile to JS" works, but has significant drawbacks.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Next steps for the web platform]

* Overhead: Download, Parse, Compile, Execute
* No integers?
* Too complex (885 pages)

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

# Enter WebAssembly

1. ISA: **WebAssembly**
2. Runtime: JavaScript + Platform APIs
3. Tooling: So so so so so many

Spec: 165 pages

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

## Previously, the web could only handle *high level* tasks.

## With wasm, the web platform can handle *low level* tasks.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

## The Web Platform is closing in on application spaces previously only possible on other platforms.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

# Aside: isn't this Java Applets? NaCL?

## NO

* One VM
* Not tied to one language
* Proper platform integration

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

## It's not just about wasm, it's also about the platform expanding:

* WebGL
* WebAudio
* WebUSB (!)

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

## Soon, "web application" does not need to be synonymous with "networked application" or "web page" or anything else we associate with the web platform today.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

## SPAs shifted *some* of the application to the client.

## This work enables *all* of the application to be on the client.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[Enter WebAssembly]

# Why is this useful?

## Universal, cross-platform applications.

## "no install neccesary"

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

# What *is* WebAssembly, anyway?

## Extremely misunderstood üôÅ

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

# Factorial

## Wasm is a compact, binary format:

```
20 00 42 00 51 04 7e 42 01 05 20
00 20 00 42 01 7d 10 00 7e 0b
```

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## It also has a text format, so you can "view source" easily.

![textual representation](img/text.png)

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## It's designed to be small, efficient, and integrate with existing JS VMs.

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## It's *not* designed to replace JavaScript

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## It has limitations, such as not being able to access the DOM

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## It has no GC integration

### This means, C, C++, and Rust

#### JavaScript does *not* compile to wasm

---
class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## You can do cool things!

class: left, top
# .slide-header[About WebAssembly]

## Traditional web applications will always be a thing.

### This is about *expansion*, not *replacement*.

# Defining functions

### The function, type, and code sections define functions

### type sections list type signatures

### code sections list code

### function sections tie them together
