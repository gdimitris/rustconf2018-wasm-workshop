# Wasm Workshop: Part 1

## By @steveklabnik

### (slides made extra awesome by @ag_dubs)

---
class: center, middle

# Agenda

### * 09:05 - 09:30: WASM overview
### * 09:30 - 10:00: a WASM "hello world"
### * 10:00 - 10:30: explain previous in depth

### Feel free to jump in with questions at any point!

# Part I

## LET'S GET HYPE

---
class: center, middle

# What is "the web platform"?

## It should be "the web *application* platform."

---
class: center, middle

# Platforms consist of:

### 1. An ISA (instruction set architecture)
### 2. A runtime environment and its API
### 3. Tooling to help you build stuff

---
class: center, middle

# Case study: UNIX on x86

### 1. ISA: x86
### 2. Runtime: UNIX (wait what?)
### 3. Tooling: shell, C, gcc

---
class: center, middle

# Case study: Java

### 1. ISA: Java Bytecode
### 2. Runtime: JVM
### 3. Tooling: javac

---
class: center, middle

### The web platform is unusual in that it was developed
## out of order
### and it historically has had
## missing pieces

---
class: center, middle

## Other platforms were local, then networked.

## The web platform is networked, and only now becoming local.

---
class: center, middle

# The browser was a *viewport* into an *application on the server*.

---
class: center, middle

# This limits the kind of applications that we can build on the web platform.

---
class: center, middle

# Where are we going?

---
class: center, middle

## Further developing the web platform's capabilities requires filling in the missing pieces.

---
class: center, middle

# Case study: Web Platform

### 1. ISA: ???
### 2. Runtime: JavaScript + Platform APIs
### 3. Tooling: So so so so so many

---
class: center, middle

# JavaScript as ISA?

## Sort of, but not *really*.

---
class: center, middle

# JavaScript was not designed for this task.

## "Compile to JS" works, but has significant drawbacks.

---
class: left, middle

### Overhead: Download, Parse, Compile, Execute
### No integers?
### Too complex (885 pages)

---
class: center, middle

# Enter WebAssembly

### 1. ISA: **WebAssembly**
### 2. Runtime: JavaScript + Platform APIs
### 3. Tooling: So so so so so many

### Spec: 165 pages

---
class: center, middle

## Previously, the web could only handle *high level* tasks.

## With wasm, the web platform can handle *low level* tasks.

---
class: center, middle

## The Web Platform is closing in on application spaces previously only possible on other platforms.

---
class: center, middle

### Aside: isn't this Java Applets? NaCL?

# NO

### * One VM
### * Not tied to one language
### * Proper platform integration

---
class: center, middle

## It's not just about wasm, it's also about the platform expanding:

### * WebGL
### * WebAudio
### * WebUSB (!)

---
class: center, middle

## Soon, "web application" does not need to be synonymous with "networked application" or "web page" or anything else we associate with the web platform today.

---
class: center, middle

## SPAs shifted *some* of the application to the client.

## This work enables *all* of the application to be on the client.

---
class: center, middle

# Why is this useful?

## Universal, cross-platform applications.

## "no install neccesary"

---
class: center, middle

# What *is* WebAssembly, anyway?

## Extremely misunderstood üôÅ

---
class: center, middle

# Factorial

## Wasm is a compact, binary format:

<h3><code>
20 00 42 00 51 04 7e 42 01 05 20
00 20 00 42 01 7d 10 00 7e 0b
</code></h3>

---
class: center, middle

## It also has a text format, so you can "view source" easily.

---
class: center, middle

## It's designed to be small, efficient, and integrate with existing JS VMs.

---
class: center, middle

## It's *not* designed to replace JavaScript

---
class: center, middle

## It has limitations, such as not being able to access the DOM

---
class: center, middle

## It has no GC integration

### This means, C, C++, and Rust

#### JavaScript does *not* compile to wasm

---
class: center, middle

## You can do cool things!

---
class: center, middle

## Traditional web applications will always be a thing.

### This is about *expansion*, not *replacement*.

# Part III

## Let's dig in!

# Explore

---
class: center, middle

# Text vs Binary format

### There are two!

# Sections (non-exhaustive)

#### * Function Section
#### * Type Section
#### * Code Section
#### * Start Section
#### * Import Section
#### * Export Section

---
class: center, middle

# Defining functions

### The function, type, and code sections define functions

### type sections list type signatures

### code sections list code

### function sections tie them together

---
class: center, middle

# Running something at the start

### The start section runs a function when the module is loaded

---
class: center, middle

# Wasm <-> JS

### The import sections declare functions you need

### The export sections declare functions you give

---
class: center, middle

# Instructions

#### https://github.com/sunfishcode/wasm-reference-manual/blob/master/WebAssembly.md#instructions

---
class: center, middle

# Memory

### A "byte" means 8 bits

### Memory is like a giant array

---
class: center, middle

# Embedding Environment

### More than just browsers!
